# Print a string that looks like a number
print("209138905671")

# Put some strings together
print("hey" + " class")

# This isn't adding. It's putting strings together
print("3" + "5")
# print("hey" - "s")  # Doesn't work!!!!!

# This is some math
print(3)
print(3 + 5)
print(3 - 5)
print(3 * 5)
print(3 / (5 - 2) + 32 * 465)

# This is multiplying the length of a string by 1000
print("hey class " * 1000)
